This is a simple Rails 3 app setup as demonstration for a dog grooming business to create customers and their dogs and setup and track
appointments.
This makes use of the jQuery 'weekcalendar' (https://github.com/themouette/jquery-week-calendar) and could be a good starting point
to anyone using rails 3, jQuery and want to use ajax and weekcalendar to dispaly events.

Should be simple setup:

1) create a database.yml file to fit needs (I use mysql and there is a method used in the search that is dependent on mysql so if you use
   another database it may have to be modified for the search functions to work)
2) run bundle install (again setup for mysql2 gem, so change as required)
3) rake db:create && rake db:migrate

That should be it. Any questions please feel free.
